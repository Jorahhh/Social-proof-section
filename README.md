## My process

1) Started with mobile screen version.
2) Used flex layout to make it in column.
3) Used @media query to make desk version (that was tough!)
4) Used @media query for screen size bigger than 1440px to make some changes
5) Added some ':hover' effects on the '.reviews' class.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The wrap in flex layout opened totally my mind and it helps me a lot to make the desk version.

main{
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: wrap;
}

### Continued development

On the next works I'll focus more on the Flex Layout and its properties. 
Also, I think I need to focus and improve a lot on the @media queries, where I still have many difficulties.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) - This helped me for the flexbox layout. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs some little advice on any of the topic
